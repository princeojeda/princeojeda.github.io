According to my friend, from our high school days, he experienced an adware attack after downloading a cracked version of a software. The website and the referral seems legit since there are good feedbacks. After the day of the installation, he noticed that there are ads that popups many times or getting redirected to a website. His computer's performance also slows down. The reasons I think that the attack was successful using the information from the table 1-2 are universal connected devices, availability and simplicity of attack tools, user confusion, and delays in updating. When he's installing the software, he didn't notice that the software is not trusted and can affect the system. After he knew that his computer is infected by an adware, he tried to use Windows Security for scanning and it shows that there's a software that is suspicious. He uninstalled it and after that, he scan it again to be sure and there's no more suspicious software. He could've prevented it if he read it carefully and doesn't install cracked versions of softwares. He should also use regularly the Windows Security or other software for scanning malicious softwares.
